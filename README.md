# Grid Demos

## What is it?

* Serves as a demo for various grid based functionality, including:
 * Layout grid
 * Visibility classes
 * Block grid
 * Form Gids
 * Nested grids (rows within rows within rows)

## What was it built with?

* AngularJS
* Ricola 3
 * Ricola 3 is a UP framework/component library that uses Foundation as its basis
* Foundation's Grid

## I checked it out.. and it doesn't work?

The framework used for most of the functionality is a custom Union Pacific framework, which I didn't feel comfortable bundling with the application. It's not hard to find the source for that application and add the CSS and JS, however.
